The following corrected CSS rule fixes the unexpected behavior:

```css
div {
  width: calc(100% - 40px);
  padding: 10px;
}
```

By subtracting `40px` (twice the padding value) from `100%`, the calculation now correctly accounts for the padding, preventing the element from overflowing its container.
