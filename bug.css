The following CSS rule is causing unexpected behavior:

```css
div {
  width: calc(100% - 20px);
  padding: 10px;
}
```

The `calc()` function is used to calculate the width of the div element. The result of the calculation is expected to be 80% of the parent container's width when the padding is considered. However, the padding is added to the width of the element, resulting in a final width greater than 100%. This causes layout issues as the element may overflow its container.
